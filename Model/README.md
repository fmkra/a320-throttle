# Model

This directory contains all `.stl` files for the A320 Throttle model.

### Convention

Files are arranged in subdirectories to make it easier to navigate and find the right file.
Every directory contains `_all.stl` file which combines all of the other files in that directory (and subdirectories) into one file. `_all.stl` file **are not** meant to be printed as a one piece. If a given part consists of many smaller parts, they are placed in a separate directory.

### Components

Here are the three main parts of the throttle model:
 - [Lever](./Lever)
 - [Trim wheel](./Trim%20wheel)
 - [Frame](./Frame)
